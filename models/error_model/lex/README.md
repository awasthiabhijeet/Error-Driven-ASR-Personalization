If Festival is unavailable for TTS, we need a different way to breakdown the pronunciation of phonemes. While we can get the phonemes from each word from most classic ASR systems, the reference words need to be broken down as well. power-asr can work with pronunciations from ASR lexicons.

Parsers are written here to extract pronunciations from common formats.
